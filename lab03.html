    <p>When comparing Part A and Part B, both approaches offer their own advantages. In **Part A**, we implemented CSS from scratch, which provided full flexibility in controlling the layout, design, and responsiveness. This allowed for custom solutions tailored to specific needs. However, in **Part B**, using Bootstrap, the process was more streamlined. Though I had to familiarize myself with Bootstrap's documentation and choose the appropriate classes, it saved time as much of the design and functionality was already built-in, eliminating the need to create everything from scratch.</p>    <p>The challenges with Part A were mostly due to the time and effort required to build everything from scratch. Writing custom CSS and handling responsiveness took significantly longer. In contrast, Part B with Bootstrap presented the initial challenge of learning which classes to use, especially for making the layout responsive. However, once I understood the framework, it was much quicker and more efficient to implement.

    While Part B was easier and faster, I appreciate the flexibility of Part A. Even though it was time-consuming, custom CSS allowed for complete creative control, enabling me to design exactly as I wanted without any limitations from pre-defined styles.</p>
