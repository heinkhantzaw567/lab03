                Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is located at the eastern edge of mainland Southeast Asia, covering approximately 331,000 square kilometers and boasting a population exceeding 100 million, making it the fifteenth-most populous country globally. It shares borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west, while maritime borders connect it to Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The capital is Hanoi, and the largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.
    
    Historically, Vietnam has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age, with early states emerging in the Red River Delta. Following Chinese rule, various dynasties shaped the nation, culminating in French colonization in the late 19th century. The 20th century was marked by significant conflict, including the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War, which ultimately led to the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule in 1976.
    
    Today, Vietnam is a developing nation with a lower-middle-income economy, facing challenges such as corruption, environmental issues, and limited civil liberties. Despite these challenges, it plays an active role in international organizations and has made strides in economic reform and global integration since the 1980s.
